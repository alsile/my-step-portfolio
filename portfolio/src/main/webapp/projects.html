      <h3>This portfolio!</h3>
      <p>I was given some starter code that gave me some text and a script for
          generating a random quotes, the rest was all me. Well, all me with
          the help of various youtube videos, stackoverflow, and w3school posts.
          This was my first project in full stack and I learned a lot. A big
          takeaway for me was that I am able to understand way more than I thought.
          A lot of stuff still goes over my head, but not as much as I would have guessed.

      <h3>Setting up Festival (C++ text-to-speech library)</h3>
      <p>The goal was to use Festival to read important in-flight data aloud at
          ground control. The setup for the library took a lot of time. I learned
          a lot about how using and developing code looks like outside of the
          classroom. In my classes, setting up a library is the one of the easiest
          steps because that usually isn't the purpose of the assignment. After
          working to set up Festival, I realized that in the real world, building
          code can be done collbartively, but there isn't a "teacher" that "gets you started".
          Thus, I developed a lot of autonomous problem-solving skills like googling things.

      <h3>Flashcards</h3>
      <p>Flashcards was a project to introduce me to Android Studio. The final version
          is an app that allows you to input questions and their answer. Once recorded,
          users can swipe through cards and try to answer the question. They can check
          their answer by tapping the card, revealing the answer. Learning to make
          this portfolio was definitely easier because of that experience.
          I could see patterns for what seems to be standard across languages.

      <h3>Mastermind</h3>
      <p>The game is slightly complicated, if you want to learn more click
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">here</a>.
           I recreated the game on a circuit board using switches and buttons to
           emulate the physical pins. The whole thing is written in SystemVerilog,
           which definitely took some getting used to. I learned a lot about how 
           writing software is different from "writing hardware".
